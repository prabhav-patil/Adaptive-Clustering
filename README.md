# Adaptive-Clustering
Adaptive splitting and merging of covariance matrices so as to achieve the best optimal fitting for the Gaussian Mixture Models

Formulation and Implementation of the well-posed equations of merge approach to combine two clusters with varying coefficients together
as well the ill-posed equations of the split approach to split one cluster into two to make the model unsupervised and Implementing the theoretical equations 
with correlation coefficients and KL-divergence with a varied.

This method is efficient in making any statistical model completely unsupervised.
